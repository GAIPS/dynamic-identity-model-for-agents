# Dynamic Identity Model For Agents

The Dynamic Identity Model for Agents is an agent-based model grounded on the Social Identity Approach that provides agents with context-dependent identities. In this repository, you can find a Jupyter Notebook of this model, explaining it step-by-step. An outline on how to embed this model in a standard social agent architecture is also given in this notebook. We are in the process of adding the corresponding Python application of the model as well. Moreover, we propose a use case based on an economic game simulation, the Dictator Game, to explore the impact of our model in the identities, behaviour and performance of agents, which you can find in an additional Jupyter Notebook.
